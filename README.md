## File Structure
- `views.py`: Contains the Django views for handling various functionalities such as rendering pages, creating, editing, and deleting quizzes, and playing quizzes.
- `util.py`: Contains utility functions used in the application, such as pagination.
- `models.py`: Defines the database models for User, Quiz, Question, Option, Quiz_attempt, and Question_attempt.
- `urls.py`: Configures the URL patterns for the application.
- `forms.py`: Contains Django forms for Quiz, Question, and Option.
- `templates/`: Contains HTML templates for rendering different pages.
- `static/`: Contains static files such as CSS and JavaScript.

## Distinctiveness and Complexity
1. **Dynamic Question Addition/Removal:**
   - The project allows dynamic addition and removal of quiz questions on the create and edit quiz page. This is achieved through client-side JavaScript (`create.js`), enhancing the user experience by enabling them to modify the quiz structure interactively.

2. **Asynchronous Communication:**
   - The play page (`play.js`) demonstrates asynchronous communication with the server using the Fetch API. It submits answers, marks the question and retrieves the leaderboard without refreshing the entire page, providing a seamless and efficient quiz-taking experience.

3. **Responsive Design:**
   - The play page features a real-time timer for each question. The timer dynamically updates, providing users with a visual representation of the time remaining to answer a question. The timer also triggers automatic submission if time runs out. In addition, the timer does not reset even when the page is refreshed, as the start time is stored in local storage.
   - Upon clicking an option, the play page dynamically updates to show the result of the player's answer. A button also appears to allow the user to proceed with the next question.
   - After completing the quiz, the user is presented with a leaderboard (`play.js`) showcasing the scores of the player's score and up to 5 other top scores. This leaderboard is also displayed and updated on the view quiz page.
   - The index page features pagination and search functions, allowing the user the easily navigate to any quiz.

4. **Aesthetics:**
    - The project makes use of many different bootstrap elements (eg. cards, list-groups, buttons) to achieve a sleek and aesthetically pleasing design. In particular, there is apt use of margins to space DOM elements appropriately.
